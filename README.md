# Miscellaneous-Projects(Updated 9/5)
A repositroy to store odds and ends from my studies. Anything from a basic dice rolling tutorial I followed, to the never-ending mini-projects I make while learning. 

Important to note that nothing I post here is all that interesting, but I often find I would like to put my work out there regardless. Feel free to use any of the code to your hearts' desires. 

I will update the README every so often with details about the projects I post here, but that will be for another time.

I have been learning a fair amount about GUI design in the past few days using tkinter & Python. It's taught me more than I was expecting, and has given me a burst of inspiration. Some of the hardest parts of coding are the points at which abstraction becomes so abstract that it's hard to figure out what needs to be coded. Visualizing this has made it a lot easier to come to grips with concepts like event-handling and project planning/design. Realpython.com has been a blessing!
