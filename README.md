# Miscellaneous-Projects
A repositroy to store odds and ends from my studies. Anything from a basic dice rolling tutorial I followed, to the never-ending mini-projects I make while learning. 

Important to note that nothing I post here is all that interesting, but I often find I would like to put my work out there regardless. Feel free to use any of the code to your hearts' desires. 

I will update the README every so often with details about the projects I post here, but that will be for another time.
